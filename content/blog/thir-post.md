# How to Add AI to Your Workflow Without Breaking It

Everyone’s talking about AI, but knowing where to start—or how to actually make it useful in your existing workflow—is a different story. It’s easy to get caught up in the hype, over-engineer a solution, or just throw ChatGPT at a problem and hope it sticks.

But AI should make your work easier, not more complicated.

### Common Mistakes When Adding AI

Before diving into how to do it right, here are a few patterns we’ve seen from teams that struggle with AI integration:

- **Too Generic**: Using out-of-the-box models with no context leads to weak outputs.
- **Over-Automation**: Trying to fully automate complex decisions without human checkpoints.
- **One-Size-Fits-All**: Forcing AI into workflows where it’s not a good fit—or trying to make it do everything.

Sound familiar? You’re not alone.

### A Better Way to Integrate AI

The key is to treat AI like a team member—not a replacement. Here’s how we recommend getting started:

#### 1. **Pick a Clear, Contained Use Case**
Don’t start with “we want to use AI.” Start with “we want to reduce time spent answering repetitive questions,” or “we want faster content drafts.” One goal, one metric.

#### 2. **Feed It Real Context**
AI thrives when it understands the background. Use existing documents, examples, and user inputs to ground the model in your world. This is where tools like **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** or frameworks like [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) can help—by pulling in relevant data at generation time.

#### 3. **Let It Ask Questions**
Your users won’t always give perfect prompts—and that’s okay. Build in space for the AI to clarify before it generates. This is what the [OpenAI Assistants API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview) is designed to support—and what we focus on at Inquiryon: helping the model *ask* before it *answers blindly.*

#### 4. **Keep a Human in the Loop**
Let the AI draft, but give people the final say. Or let it triage, but escalate the edge cases. Think of AI as an assistant, not a decider.

### How Inquiryon Supports This

We built Inquiryon to make this process smoother, especially for teams new to AI. Our platform guides users in forming better prompts, helps the model gather the right context, and always leaves room for human insight.

It’s AI, grounded in reality—not just a flashy add-on.

        To make a good lesson plan just for you, can you answer a few quick
        questions?
      </p>,
      <p>
        1. What do you want the lesson to be about? <br />
        2. Who is it for? (Age or Grade?) <br />
        3. How long should it be? <br />
        4. Is there anything specific you want them to learn or be able to do by
        the end?

        <u>Duration:</u> 1 Hour<br /><br />
    
        <strong>Objective:</strong><br />
        Students will be able to understand and solve basic division problems using real-life examples and repeated subtraction.<br /><br />
    
        <strong>Materials Needed:</strong><br />
        - Whiteboard and markers<br />
        - Paper and pencils<br />
        - Counters or small objects (e.g., beans, cubes)<br /><br />
    
        <strong>Structure:</strong><br />
        <u>1. Introduction (10 mins)</u><br />
        - Quick review of multiplication<br />
        - Connect division as “splitting equally”<br /><br />
    
        <u>2. Guided Practice (20 mins)</u><br />
        - Demonstrate division with counters<br />
        - Work through 3–5 examples together<br /><br />
    
        <u>3. Individual Practice (20 mins)</u><br />
        - Students solve worksheet problems on their own<br />
        - Teacher walks around to support<br /><br />
    
        <u>4. Wrap-Up (10 mins)</u><br />
        - Review answers together<br />
        - Ask a few reflection questions (e.g., “What was tricky?”)<br /><br />
    
        <strong>Assessment:</strong><br />
        - Observe participation and accuracy in individual work.

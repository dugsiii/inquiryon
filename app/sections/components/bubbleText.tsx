        To make a good lesson plan just for you, can you answer a few quick
        questions?
      </p>,
      <p>
        1. What do you want the lesson to be about? <br />
        2. Who is it for? (Age or Grade?) <br />
        3. How long should it be? <br />
        4. Is there anything specific you want them to learn or be able to do by
        the end?
      </p>,

        Mathematics, 3rd Grade, 1 hour or less, and we are learning basic
        division and times tables.

        Thanks for sharing—that really helps! Here&#39;s another question to make the
        lesson plan even better:
      </p>,
      <p>Would you prefer a mix of individual work and group activities?</p>,

        Got it! Last question—do you want to include any online resources or
        games in the lesson?

      <p>Actually, I don&#39;t want to answer any more questions right now.</p>,

        No problem! I&#39;ll go ahead and create a lesson plan based on what you&#39;ve
        shared so far. Here it is!

        From your profile on this class, it seems it is a 3rd grade math class where they&#39;re currently learning basic division. With the growing emphasis on personalized learning, would you like to incorporate an online resource, such as a website that offers interactive math worksheets, allowing students to practice division at their own pace?
